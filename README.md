# Project-Codes-
This repository lists all my project report codes or EDA/rough analysis codes done so far. I mainly use either R or Python. 
The majority of the codes are raw and for personal purposes; thus, some does not have explaining comments. 
There are reports that have dicussions in Chinese, since my internship was done in a China-based company.
